# ASSESSMENT 3: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.


1. What is object destructuring?

  Your answer:
  Object destructuring is declaring an object as a variable in a function that is in state so you can refer to the object without saying this.state prior during that function.

  Researched answer:
  Destructuring is unpacking an object to make it usable as a variable.



2. What are React lifecycle methods? Provide three examples.

  Your answer:
  React lifecycle methods are the import, render and export.
  The import will tell the file to bring together any components
  The render will take where all functions and data are brought together and used accordingly
  The export compiles the render so it is then useable in the virtual DOM

  Researched answer:
Mounting, Updating and Unmounting.
Mounting is putting components into the DOM such as the import and constructors, declaring states and even the functions in state.
Updating is the action so to speak.  When a component is changed in the virtual DOM - the component is updated
Unmounting is when a component is removed from the DOM.  The action is complete and the page is refreshed with all new components.


3. What is the difference between a class and an object?

  Your answer:
  A class is a descriptor for a sequence of things while an object will have multiple components to it allowing you to organize data efficiently.

  Researched answer:
A class is the blueprint for objects defining the properties of the object or object behavior.  The object is the collection of data to be called on or behavior to manipulate or change data.


4. What is the difference between a HTML div and a span?

  Your answer:
  A div creates a section that can be used as a container for the rest of the tags and elements inside.
  Span will cover the rest of the elements.

  Researched answer:
A div is used as a container for a section of code, while span contains small portions of text or images.


5. What is a React Fragment (or <>) and why would you want to use it?

  Your answer:
  React Fragments show React where JSX is being used.  It allows the program to know that there will be both html and javascript components.

  Researched answer:
React Fragments allows React to pass inherited lists to children easily.  This is often used when you have multiple states you wish to pass to a child component.


6. What does it mean to create a responsive UI? What are three options for creating responsive design?

  Your answer:
  A responsive UI is a user interface that a user can interact with.  There is an action called by the user and a result from functions being ran.
  You could have an onclick button or square to allow the user to click something and an action happens.
  You could have a selector so the user can select an option.
  You could have a search or text bar where the user asks for the computer to return something directly.

  Researched answer:
A responsive UI is a user interface that can adjust to different screen sizes without causing bugs or scaling issues.  
One way for creating responsive design is to start building with small screen sizes in mind, and later scale up to a larger screen size.
Another way is to us grids to block out your webpage.
Lastly, you can use tools such as bootstrap to help with scalability.  Also making a wireframe can help laying out the proper dimensions.


7. What are props in React?

  Your answer:
  Props are inherited traits from react state into it's child compontents.  Props allows the child to access the behavior or state from the parent -- usually App.js

  Researched answer:
Props are unidirectional data flow in React from different components.  Props is what we use to access parent data or behavior in a child class.


8. What is `this` in JavaScript?

  Your answer:
  'This' allows us to use state and access state in different parts of our code in React.

  Researched answer:
'this' binds the state in react so we can access it as props in child components or in the main component.


9. STRETCH: What is a ternary operator in JavaScript?

  Your answer:

  Researched answer:
The ternary operator is a way of using shortened if statement to render a specific condition.  For instance, if you want to display a prompt when first landing on page, you can use a ternary operator to only show that at prompt and then proceed to next information.


10. STRETCH: What is an anonymous function in JavaScript?

  Your answer:
  An anonymous function is a function that is called indirectly from an action.

  Researched answer:
An anonymous function is when you have declared a function without an identifier.  


## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week
- Ruby
    Ruby is open source, object oriented programming language that can be embedded into HTML, and is known for it's ease in reading and writing.
- Object oriented programming
    Object oriented programming is creating containers for larger programs, so it can be worked on in sections instead of affecting everything in the program.
- RSpec
    Is the Ruby testing framework
- Instance variable
    information in variable is restricted to object only
- Ruby blocks
    is ruby's version of anonymous functions that allow code to be passed to a method
- Ruby hashes
    A collection of keys and values similar to an array only each value is referenced by a key.
